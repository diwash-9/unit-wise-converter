# Unit Converter

A simple and elegant **Unit Converter** React app designed to convert between various unit types like length, area, volume, weight, time, and temperature — all powered by local JSON data.

## About This Project

This project was built as a **learning exercise** to deepen understanding of React hooks, state management, controlled inputs, and UI/UX design using Tailwind CSS. It also helped me practice working with unit conversion logic, handling different unit types (including temperature formulas), and implementing features like conversion history and clipboard copy.

## Features

- Convert units across multiple categories: Length, Area, Volume, Weight, Time, and Temperature
- Intuitive and clean user interface with subtle dropdown selects and modern styling
- Swap units easily with a swap button
- Conversion history for quick access to previous conversions
- Copy conversion results to clipboard with confirmation feedback
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** — UI library for building interactive user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Local JSON data** — unit conversion data and formulas stored locally for offline use

# Learning Outcomes
Managing complex state with React hooks (useState, useEffect)

Building reusable components with clean, accessible UI

Handling unit conversions with dynamic formulas and factors

Working with controlled form inputs and validation

Creating a persistent conversion history and copy-to-clipboard functionality

Styling modern UIs with Tailwind CSS including dropdowns and buttons

# Future Improvements
Add dark mode toggle

Support for more unit categories (e.g., speed, data size)

Store history in local storage for persistence across sessions

Provide detailed explanations for each unit and conversion

Add animations and micro-interactions for enhanced user experience
